- Implement `AsyncSequence` for streaming data

## Data Persistence
- Use Swift Data framework for data modeling and persistence
- Implement `@Model` macro for SwiftUI integration with Swift Data

## Security
- Utilize Privacy Manifests for third-party SDKs
- Implement App Privacy Report integration

## Accessibility
- Use VoiceOver enhancements in iOS 18
- Implement Live Speech functionality where appropriate

## Performance
- Adopt Metal 3 for high-performance graphics
- Utilize on-device machine learning with Core ML 6

## App Architecture
- Implement App Intents for Siri and Shortcuts integration
